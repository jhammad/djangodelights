### Restaurant inventory project to practice python and django

This website was developed using Python 4.1.2 and was coded in Visual Studio Code. Git version control was used to track the changes.

The project has the following features:


1. Home Page
2. Ingredients
3. Menu Items
4. Recipe requirements
5. Purchases
6. Create new account page

The users should be able to complete the following task:

* Users can log in, log out, and must be logged in to see the views
* Users can create items for the menu
* Users can add ingredients to the restaurant’s inventory and update their quantities
* Users can add the different recipe requirements for each menu item
* Users can record purchases of menu items (only the ones that are able to be created with what’s in the inventory!)
* Users can view the current inventory, menu items, their ingredients, and a log of all purchases made
